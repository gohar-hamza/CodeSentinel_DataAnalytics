# CodeSentinel_DataAnalytics
This repository contains all the tasks I completed during my remote internship in Data Analytics at Code Sentinel. It showcases my work, learnings, and practical implementations throughout the internship.
# 📊 Data Analytics Internship Project  

## 📌 Overview  
This repository contains my **Data Analytics Internship Project**, where I worked on **5 major tasks** involving dataset exploration, cleaning, visualization, sales analysis, and dashboard development.  
The project demonstrates my ability to use **Python (Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib)** for data handling and **Tableau** for dashboard creation.

## 🚀 Tasks  

### **Task 1 – Dataset Exploration (Iris Dataset)**  
- Loaded the Iris dataset using Seaborn.  
- Explored dataset structure, column names, and row/column counts.  
- Checked data types and generated summary statistics.  
- **Key Learning:** Understood dataset structure and prepared for analysis.  

---

### **Task 2 – Data Cleaning (Titanic Dataset)**  
- Handled missing values:  
  - Filled `Age` with median.  
  - Filled `Embarked` with mode.  
  - Dropped `Deck` column (too many missing values).  
- Converted categorical columns into numerical using **label encoding**.  
- **Key Learning:** Cleaned and preprocessed raw data for further analysis.

### **Task 3 – Data Visualization (Titanic Dataset)**  
- Created various visualizations using **Seaborn & Matplotlib**:  
  - Survival rates by **gender** and **class**.  
  - Passenger class distribution (Pie Chart).  
  - Age distribution (Histogram).  
  - Age by passenger class (Boxplot).  
- **Key Insights:**  
  - Women had higher survival rates than men.  
  - First-class passengers survived more compared to third-class.  
  - Most passengers were aged between 20–40.

### **Task 4 – Sales Data Analysis (Superstore Dataset)**  
- Grouped and analyzed sales data by **region, category, and customer segment**.  
- **Key Findings:**  
  - **West Region** had the highest sales.  
  - **Technology** category contributed the most to revenue.  
  - **Office Supplies** had the lowest sales.  
  - Average sales were highest in the **Home Office** segment.  

---

### **Task 5 – Dashboard (HR Data in Tableau)**  
- Built an **interactive HR Analytics Dashboard** in Tableau.  
- Dashboard Features:  
  - Employee count, attrition count, attrition rate, and active employees.  
  - Department-wise attrition distribution.  
  - Employee distribution by age groups.  
  - Job satisfaction ratings across job roles.  
  - Education field-wise attrition.  
  - Attrition rate by gender and age groups.
